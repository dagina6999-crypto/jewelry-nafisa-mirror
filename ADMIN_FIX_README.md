# Admin Panel Users Management Fix

## Problem Summary
The users management screen in the admin panel was showing empty because:
1. **RLS Policy Conflict**: Row Level Security policies were blocking admin access to the users table
2. **Field Mapping Issues**: Database field names didn't match the AppUser model expectations  
3. **Role Type Mismatch**: Database stores roles as enums but the model expected strings

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies (`supabase/migrations/20251101000000_fix_admin_rls_policies.sql`)
- **Dropped conflicting policies** that only allowed users to see their own profiles
- **Created comprehensive policy** that allows both self-access and admin access
- **Added is_approved column** to support the UI filtering by approval status
- **Created admin user** for testing (admin@jewelry-nafisa.com)

### 2. Fixed Field Mapping (`lib/src/admin/services/admin_service.dart`)
- **Added _mapUserFromDatabase method** to handle field mapping correctly
- **Updated getUsers method** to use the new mapping function
- **Fixed role handling** to convert enum values to strings
- **Improved username fallback** to use full_name if username is not available

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
```bash
cd jewelry_nafisa
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Login as Admin
- Use email: `admin@jewelry-nafisa.com`
- Password needs to be set through Supabase Auth dashboard

### Step 3: Test Users Management
1. Navigate to Admin Panel â†’ Users Management
2. Check all three tabs: Members, Non-Members, B2B Creators
3. Verify users are loading and displaying correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

The users tab will now properly show:
- **Members**: Users with `is_member = true`
- **Non-Members**: Users with `is_member = false`  
- **B2B Creators**: Users with `role = 'designer'`

Each user will display username, email, role, membership status, approval status, and registration date.
